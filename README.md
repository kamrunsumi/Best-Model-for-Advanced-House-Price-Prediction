# Best-Model-for-Advanced-House-Price-Prediction
It is undeniable that house prices have increased in recent year. Therefore, we need a robust model which can accurately predict future houses. House price
prediction can help the developer determine the selling price of a house and can help the customer to arrange the right time to purchase a house. There are 
three salient factors that influence the price of a house which include physical conditions, design, and location. The goal of this project is to accurately 
predict house sales of city Ames at Iowa state. Using the historical sales data, we built multiple linear regression (Model 1 and Model 2), Random forest, 
lasso, and ridge regression to successfully predict house price.
